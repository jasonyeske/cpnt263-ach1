### To DO: Install Chart.js

- I will attempt to install the program by cloning the repo
    - repo cloned into my in-class folder
    - npm install
- create html file
- copy paste example code from Chart.js file
    - Not working (?)

### Bug fixing time!
- try different ways to fix it
    - tried different code from a different website
    - try making new folder and putting html file inside
    - try moving the html file out of the Chart.js file all together and using CDN install
        - fixed!
            - Learned that the html file cannot be inside of the installed the libary, so CDN is easiest for getting this to work

### Playing around with the chart
- Changed some of the numbers on the x and y axis
    - numbers appearing off the chart
        -  change the min number on the x and y axis to fix (fixed)

- I used the sample code from w3schools and they helped me play around with the code as well





- I installed the library using CDN in the head of the file.
